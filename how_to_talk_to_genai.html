<p>Now that we have a high-level understanding of <a href="what_is_generative_ai.html#llms">how large language models work</a>, we can move to the application that has made them so famous—AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. In this section, we will focus on limitations of such models and strategies to overcome these limitations. Generally, this course is tool agnostic, and what you will learn here should be true for any LLM-based application. For completeness, though, it is worth providing a brief overview of <a href="genai_tools.html">the main options</a> available to you.</p>
<h2 id="starting-point">Starting point</h2>
<p>I think the good starting point would be to talk to AI models just as you would talk to a human assistant. Use natural language and be specific in your requests—just as humans can‘t read your mind, neither can AI models. While it’s important to be aware of potential mistakes, I think some people tend to overemphasise this concern. It‘s worth remembering that no source is entirely free from errors: software has bugs, encyclopaedias contain inaccuracies, and making mistakes is fundamentally human.</p>
<p>I have to mention that some critics argue against anthropomorphising chatbots, suggesting we should be very careful about using terms like artificial “intelligence”<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">&ldquo;there has been little discussion about how &lt;&hellip;&gt; the term artificial “intelligence”, has been used to legitimize powerful and false ideologies that serve to diminish human and worker rights“ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14042">The brain is a computer is a brain: neuroscience’s internal debate and the social significance of the Computational Metaphor</a> (Baria &amp; Cross, 2021)&#160;</span> or saying that these systems “understand”<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">”these successes sometimes lead to hype in which these models are being described as “understanding” language&rdquo; <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463/">On Meaning, Form, and Understanding in the Age of Data</a> (Bender &amp; Koller, 2020)&#160;</span> or “think”, emphasising that AI models differ profoundly from how humans reason and use language<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html">Noam Chomsky: The False Promise of ChatGPT</a>&#160;</span>. Personally, I think that the dangers of anthropomorphising are overstated—humans anthropomorphise everything from natural phenomena to tools in their daily lives without assuming these things are conscious. And as we discussed earlier, the term “artificial intelligence” has existed for more than half a century; I don’t think it’s necessary to rename it now. However, I invite you to explore the provided references to form your own opinion on this topic.</p>
<p>That said, there are of course differences between AI models and humans. Not all of these differences are limitations—some can be advantageous. In this section, you will learn both how to be cautious when working with LLMs and how to benefit from their unique characteristics. Finally, we will discuss specific strategies that can help you interact with these models more effectively.</p>
