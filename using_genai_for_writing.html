<p>Writing is arguably the most important skill in academia. Of course, it goes without saying that you should know how to do research. However, even if your science is solid and your paper is poorly written, it would never be accepted in a top journal. Unfortunately, the reverse isn‘t always true and one can find polished papers in top journals containing fundamental analytical flaws.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of academia is that it’s a reputation-based institution. Your social connections are essential for a successful career, and these connections depend on your reputation.</p>
<p>Given the importance of writing skills and reputation, you should be extremely careful when it comes to writing. It goes beyond following policies, which you should obviously do. Even if a certain venue allows using GenAI in writing, if your colleagues feel that your language is too “ChatGPTish” and they dislike it, this could cause serious reputational damage. It wouldn‘t matter if it was allowed or not. You don’t want to develop a reputation as a lazy, sloppy writer.</p>
<p>At the same time, given the importance of writing and that so many researchers are non-native speakers, it also generates a lot of inequalities. GenAI could potentially serve as an equaliser helping people who are not native English speakers to polish their writing. In fact, Springer Nature explicitly allows for using AI-assisted copy editing of manuscripts without requiring disclosure<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/editorial-policies/artificial-intelligence--ai-/25428500">Editorial Policies: AI Authorship</a>&#160;</span>.</p>
<p>With these considerations in mind, I would generally recommend using GenAI to improve your writing rather than trying to save time on writing. Personally, I often use GenAI for writing but I don‘t think I spend less time on it. I still work a lot on texts, writing drafts, re-writing drafts, editing, etc. What is different is that the final outcome is probably better thanks to access to Generative AI. There cannot be universal advice when it comes to using GenAI for writing, as it depends a lot on your personal style and your own writing process. But I’ll share what worked for me as you might find it useful.</p>
