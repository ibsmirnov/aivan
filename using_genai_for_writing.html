<p>Writing is arguably the most important skill in academia, because you know, it‘s important to be able to do science, but it’s impossible to find a paper in a top journal that would be poorly written, even if analysis is very good. But it‘s unfortunately possible to find papers that would be written very well, but analysis is flawed. And another important thing about academia is that it’s reputation based, and your social connections are very important, and social connections depend a lot on your reputation. And that‘s why you have to be extremely careful regarding writing. So it’s not only just about ethics, or if it‘s prohibited or not by a certain venue, but for example if people see that your language is too chatty GPT-ish, and they dislike it, then you know, it doesn’t matter if it was allowed or not, you can get serious reputational damage, and it could affect your whole career. So that‘s why, you know, be very careful with writing.  </p>
<p>At the same time, because writing is so important, and there is obviously inequalities with respect to writing, especially for people who are non-native speakers, this means that GNI can be an important source for reducing these inequalities. So the idea here is, what I would recommend for you is to use GNI to improve your writing, and not, for example, to save time on writing. So I often use GNI for my writing, but I don’t think I spend any less time on this. Yeah, I still work a lot with text, write, rewrite it, etc. It‘s just the final outcome is probably better because I have access to generative AI.  </p>
<p>So my advice here would be to, yeah, trying to find a way where you can kind of, where there can be a growth. And there’s some like ideas, like for example, Vygotsky was telling that there are like kind of skills that you already know, and there‘s no learning in this sphere because it’s something you already know, you can do it on your own. It‘s also something that you cannot do, even if there is like help. So it was, in his context, it was about childhood development, so it was usually kids with adults. So if you cannot do it, then there’s also like no growth. And there is something that was called the zone of proximity development, something that you cannot yet do on your own, but you can do it with your help. So I think your goal with writing in academia should be trying to work in AI in this kind of zone, doing, not trying to substitute your work, but maybe, you know, trying to do something that would be otherwise for you kind of complicated.  </p>
<p>So, one, this might sound a bit too abstract, so I want to provide you with a specific example. So, for example, I‘ve seen that some people kind of, they write something, and then ask them, you know, did you use JGPT for that? And they say, yeah, and ask, you know, but, you know, do you know what this particular work means? Like exactly what they pointed, and they say no. And I think a very good example, like, you know, you’re using words that you don‘t know exactly what it means in your text just because JGPT suggested it.  </p>
<p>So, what instead I recommend is to use, never do this, and use words that you know. And then how I will grow? Well, I think you will grow because there is a difference between passive vocabulary and textual vocabulary. And as we discussed before at some point, it’s also usually easier to evaluate the quality of text than to produce good text on your own. So, there‘s this kind of zone when something that you can actually able to evaluate and able because, you know, you know all the words, you know constructions, you’re able to evaluate this sentence, but, you know, you are still struggling to produce it on your own. So, yeah. So, I think if this sentence was generated by AI bot, AI system, then you are free to use it. That‘s something that you could potentially generate or not.  </p>
<p>And then sometimes there will be options when, you know, you see words that you didn’t ever seen before. Maybe you‘ve seen it before, but, you know, you’re not sure about the exact meaning. So, maybe that‘s for you an opportunity to check this meaning. You can actually just ask. Yeah, you can actually just ask. And then you just remember this and then you will be, you know, reading other papers, other books, you will listen to the speakers and you now like whenever you see this word, you probably remember it and like see how other people use it and you can move it from passive vocabulary to textual vocabulary and you will be better.  </p>
<p>So, yeah. And then just maybe a couple of, that I think is important. Like, you know, you can, I don’t want to provide specific tips because it‘s up to you, it’s up to your style, people do differently. But it‘s kind of a general idea that I want to communicate. What I usually do, yeah, I try to, I always start with writing my own text and now increasingly I started to write an audio memo and that, you know, generally took in this transcript for me because it saves a lot of time on this kind of drafting approach. Yeah, after that, I usually ask chatGPT to, you know, to check for like English grammar and I asked it to make changes minimum.  </p>
<p>So, it’s kind of still really close to my text. I usually don‘t need to, sometimes I need to edit it just to make it sound like my text. And so, that means that I have like this kind of version for text. And then I start to work with it as I would usually work with text. I would kind of read, think if it’s good or not, if it should change something. And, you know, if I made a lot of changes by my own, I usually, again, ask chatBot to check if I didn‘t introduce any errors. And if I’m really struggling with something, some ideas, yeah, I can ask chatGPT to provide me with these ideas. And, yeah, that’s kind of my own process.</p>
