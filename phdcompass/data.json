So basically I am at the end of second year of my PhD and sadly the examiners didn\u2019t pass me and I have now been given 3 months to submit the work which is quite extensive work (I need to first gain ethics approval for the study, collect data and analyse it). My supervisors also said that 3 months are not enough. Twice in my PhD my supervisors were changed and the current ones are not helpful at all. Due to first supervisory changes, year 1 was complete waste of time. Now in year 2 alone I wrote 40k words and did so much work. Can you ask the community what would they suggest me to do? 1. Ask the uni to let me switch from full time to part time (I am not sure if they will allow me to do that) to allow myself more time and hopefully examiners would consider that I will have some time. At the moment they are concerned that only one study is completed and I have one year left and another year for write up. 2. Wait until Dec (if examiners don\u2019t pass me this time, they will ask me to graduate with Mphil) 3. Or any other option?",

I worked around 3 weeks for that project and measured all the EPR data in this project. Since I was a first year PhD student I didn\u2019t know how to treat the data so my supervisor did it and did not teach me. A few months later, the data was published in paper in a very good journal. The paper had only three authors: the girl I was collaborating with, her PI and my PI. My name was in the acknowledgments together with other people. My boss said that it was ok that my name wasn\u2019t there because there were going to be other projects and did not fight to put my name as an author, and at that time I didn\u2019t really know how that works.

For years, I was given additional teaching load because \"it will be good for my cv.\" 4 years into the program, one of my advisors started pressuring me to quit early because they needed to hire assistant professors. It was not ideal, but I had enough papers to finish the dissertation.

Despite my dedication to research and teaching assistant responsibilities, I feel a lack of mentorship, and this situation has left me uncertain about my progress and abilities.

Unfortunately, the rest of my supervisory panel never had a single meeting with me, which resulted in me submitting the thesis independently.

I am puzzled as to why the school is not granting me the opportunity to revise and resubmit my thesis in this case. While I had the chance to briefly review the reports at school, both negative reports criticize the lack of novelty in my research and insufficient experimentation for the thesis. However, according to the oral presentation milestone I have achieved, it was my supervisor, who is now retired, who commented that I have conducted enough experiments to warrant an A-grade PhD thesis. It has been 7 years since I started my PhD journey. I had my final oral presentation in December 2019. However, I am still struggling to complete my PhD. Any helpful advice is highly appreciated.",
    "I had my PhD viva a few days ago and I really enjoyed it (and did very well, I think). The examiners acknowledged my original contribution to knowledge without even asking me that question. Nevertheless, I passed with \"Major Revisions\" which came a bit as a shock (to my supervisor as well) after a well-managed viva. The examiners said I won't need another viva again as they were very pleased with me but that my thesis would need some major revisions. They are confident that I will be able to make them even before the 12 months deadline. While I'm waiting for their report on the amendments I should make, I am experiencing some mixed feelings now and interrogating my worth. Was a PhD the right thing for me? After amendments, will they accept it? Why are most people congratulating me when I really feel like it is a \"revise and resubmit\" and that I nearly failed? I am lost and confused.\u201d",
    "Four months into the program, my advisor decided not to continue working with me without prior notice. Another professor advised me, and now, as I explore research in another lab, I'm feeling disheartened, I\u2019m in so much pain. I'm concerned that my previous advisor might share negative opinions about me, despite their harsh approach and occasional discouragement. It simply didn't work between us, and despite my best efforts, the start was difficult. I'm unsure how to navigate this situation.",
    "I feel so relieved after withdrawing a postdoc application because the potential supervisor was very aggressive in exerting their personal research interest and also rude, saying that I don't know anything about the topic that I am going to work on even though it's based on my doctoral research. How could a senior academic be that rude to a newly minted PhD graduate? Academia could look so ugly, ugh.",
    "One of my friend has done two masters. She has done two internships but could not get admission in PhD program. She is now back to India and applying to many PhD programs outside Indian in the hope to get a PhD admit. How do I tell her that she is more than an admit and focus on her health and other things?",
    "Hi! I have this doubt. Do I must necessarily have published a peer review paper, in order to apply for a PhD position?",
    "I'm doing PhD in social sciences in India and have scholarship until July 2024. I'm hoping to start my data collection till then. I want to apply for international fellowship opportunities after that to continue my research without the pressure to do multiple jobs. Any leads for such opportunities or sources to find them would be highly appreciated. My focus is on LGBTQ mental health.",
    "After submission, what do you all typically do with papers written for graduate-level courses? I wrote a number this semester that I think are of decent quality (as least per prof. feedback) that are not explicitly related to my research/labwork but would like to publicize. Suggestions? TIA!!",
    "Does anyone have any tips for the \"Commitment to Training\" section of grant apps? I've described my lab training environment, listed the courses I plan to take/audit, noted the core resources I will use.. am I missing something? How do I make my training plan stand out?",
    "I'm roughly 6 months into my PhD, and I still feel like I've not done anything of any worth. Is this normal?",
    "any other PhD students not get along with their PI and want to change but can\u2019t because they are the only person in your field of research in the department? Or changed project to keep scholarship if PI tries to fire you! Help needed please!",
    "My advisor invited a speaker to my programs seminar talk. The talk was fabulous and I even got the chance to talk more with the speaker afterwards. When I noted what lab I was in, the speaker mentioned that he has met other members of my lab at a dinner last night. The other graduate students from my lab were at this dinner, but I didn\u2019t receive an invite and wouldn\u2019t have ever heard about it if it weren\u2019t for me going up afterwards to ask a question. I am upset about this and believe that my advisor thinks poorly of me because of it. Should I bring this up to my advisor? Or does is this an issue I should keep to myself?",
    "I want to ask what if there is a big argument between student and supervisor, what should we do? (e.g. Supervisor send a really rude email to students)"
