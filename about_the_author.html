<p>Ivan Smirnov is a computational social scientist whose work sits at the intersection of technology and society. His current focus is on GenAI both as a research tool and subject of inquiry. He studies AI-assisted cheating and inequity in GenAI use in higher education. He also employs advanced computational methods to better understand PhD students‘ experiences and explores AI’s potential role in helping students from equity groups navigate the hidden curriculum in academia.</p>
<p>Beyond his core research, Dr. Smirnov is deeply committed to nurturing the next generation of scientists through teaching, development of open educational resources, and social entrepreneurship. He currently teaches the “Getting Started with Generative AI in Research” course for the GRS School at UTS.</p>
<p>Prior to joining UTS, he served as an Assistant Professor at the University of Mannheim and led a research group at the Higher School of Economics. His research has been published in leading venues including Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and featured in major media outlets such as ABC TV, MIT Technology Review, and Nature.</p>
