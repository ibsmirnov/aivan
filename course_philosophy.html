        <h1>Course philosophy</h1>
<p>Today, there are plenty of ways to learn about GenAI. What, I believe, sets this course apart is that it‘s based on discussing research papers. To make this statement less abstract, let me illustrate the course philosophy with a specific example.</p>
<p>In many learning materials, you might encounter advice to assign a specific persona to GenAI. For example, if you want ChatGPT to help you write an email to resolve a difficult situation, you might start your request by saying “You are a well-known negotiator.” If you’re going to ask GenAI to help with text annotation, you might say “you‘re a linguist with 15 years of experience in text analysis.”</p>
<p>The problem with this advice is that it isn’t grounded in evidence. In fact, there is a research paper that systematically examines this strategy and finds that “adding personas does not improve model performance across a range of questions”<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.888/">When ”A Helpful Assistant” Is Not Really Helpful: Personas in System Prompts Do Not Improve Performances of Large Language Models</a> (Zheng et al., EMNLP 2024)&#160;</span>. Another paper even suggests that assigning a persona to ChatGPT increases the toxicity of its outputs<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.88/">Toxicity in chatgpt: Analyzing persona-assigned language models</a> (Deshpande et al., EMNLPs 2023)&#160;</span>.</p>
<p>However, simply dismissing personas and citing these references would be misleading, as these studies don‘t consider all possible contexts. By discussing the papers in detail, I hope to help learners move beyond simplistic statements like “personas are useful” or “personas don’t work” and enable them to form a more nuanced, evidence-based understanding.</p>
