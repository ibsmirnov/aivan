<p>As I have mentioned, not all differences between AI models and humans are negative. AI assistants have vast knowledge, they are non-judgmental and infinitely patient. I have mentioned that it is useful to be specific when talking to AI; however, humans might be annoyed if they think you‘re being overly specific. Models won’t care and it might be useful to provide as many details as possible for your task.</p>
<p>You could also drop some conventional constraints. Sometimes when I write, I can switch to another language if I know the exact expression only in that language—the models will automatically translate it, e.g. &ldquo;Please, proofread: I’ve just наткнулся на статью where authors compared &lt;&hellip;&gt;“. You can also ask them to generate as many responses as you want, e.g. ”&lt;&hellip;&gt; Please provide me with at least 20 options&rdquo;. One trick that I use is to ask not just for many options, but to generate them along a specific spectrum. This way, I can select the most appropriate version or mix elements from different options to suit my style and purpose. For example, if I want help crafting an email about rescheduling an appointment, I might ask to generate ten answers with increasing levels of politeness. Check out the sample output below.</p>

<p>My overall recommendation would be to remember that you don‘t have to stick to conventional constraints and shouldn’t be afraid to experiment with different types of requests. Let’s now move to the <a href="be_aware_of_differences_with_humans.html">next section</a> where we will learn about the limitations of LLMs.</p>
