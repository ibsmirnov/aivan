<p>When generative AI tools for creating images, such as DALL-E, became widespread, some researchers apparently decided it was a good idea to use them to generate scientific illustrations. For example, in one now-retracted paper, the following illustration appeared, and as you can easily see, it is completely nonsensical.</p>
<figure class="image-with-annotation">

<p>It is probably self-evident that such cheating is a bad idea, but I want to emphasize that this is especially important in science because, as an institution, science is fundamentally based on trust and without this trust, science cannot work effectively and might even collapse. That‘s why, as a community, we are not only normatively interested in avoiding cheating but also pragmatically.</p>
<p>I also want too note that this is not a new problem, and obvious cases like the one above are probably less problematic as they are easily detectable. More sophisticated image manipulation existed long before Generative AI. Check out the image below and try to determine what is wrong with it. As a non-specialist in the field, I cannot see any issues. And apparently even specialists missed them, as this image was published in Nature and retracted only 13 years later.</p>

<p>There are, however, legitimate uses for AI-generated images. For example, you can include them in your presentations as an easy way to create high-quality visuals. Check out these two images that I’ve used in my presentations. I needed the first one to create a feeling of facing a complex, difficult-to-navigate problem, and the other to convey a sense of renewal. I‘m not an expert in visual design, but I believe these images are working quite well given that each required only one prompt to create.</p>

<p>I would, however, warn against overusing AI-generated images. I’ve seen presentations where every slide included an obviously AI-generated image. Creating these images is very easy, but that doesn‘t mean you should always do so. Sometimes adding an image to a slide just creates visual noise without improving your presentation.</p>
<p>I would also warn regarding an easily recognisable default style of AI-generated images. Check out what I get when I tried to use “lazy” prompt to generate images for courses about GenAI, Synthetics Biology, and Gender Equality.  </p>

<p>As you can see, they’re all kind of in the same style. There is too much detail. The color palette is really strange. There is also a lot of unnatural characters or symbols many of which seem to be half-drawn. You can easily see much more such examples if you just go to your linkedin feed. Such images generates fatigue and I don‘t think you would benefit of using them.</p>
<p>It is definitely not a fundamental limitation of the technology because as people discovered, you can do a lot more interesting things, especially when professional artists are working on that. Checkout these images generated with GenAI.</p>

<p>I think this also underscore a more universal fact when it comes to generative AI. People who already experts in their respecitve field are not threatened by this tools but become its main beneficials. Being able to distinguish between good and bad visuals becomes important when using GenAI. Just knowing what is out there, what styles you might want to mix to achieve the desired results is also important. This is defenitely what we can see in image generating domains but I believe it is true for other domains as well.</p>
<p>The image generating capabiliteis are integrated in many major tools such ChatGPT, Gemini, or Grok. It probably worth noting that many consider Midjourney to be the most advanced image generating tool available today. Also that there are models that can be run locally on your computer, which is probably the best option for those who don’t want to pay for a subscription (Stable Diffusion). And some solutions trying to solve the copyright issue, like Exactly AI.</p>
