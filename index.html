        <h1>Getting Started with Generative AI in Research</h1>
<p>Welcome to “Getting Started with Generative AI in Research.” This online course provides a high-level understanding of technologies behind GenAI, explores use cases in research, and highlights ethical implications. While the course is primarily designed for Ph.D. students, it might be useful for the general public and experienced researchers as well. What sets the course apart from many other offerings is that it’s built around research papers, which I hope will help learners develop a critical, evidence-based understanding of how to work effectively and ethically with generative AI. Please, see <a href="course_philosophy.html">Course philosophy</a> for more details about my approach.</p>
